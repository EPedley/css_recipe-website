# recipe_website

Welcome to my family's recipe website! I originally built a very primitive website using HTML as part of my progress through The Odin Project, however I really enjoyed using CSS and HTML. As such I wanted to build on this concept and create a small passion project - a website to host all my favourote recipes from childhood! I'm always having to ask family members for old recipes, and often lose the recipes in tonnes of Whatsapp messages, so I wanted to make them easy to access for myself and my family. I am hoping to continue adding more recipes as my family request them.

As I've worked on this project I have learned how to:
- Add styles to HTML with CSS
- Understand how to use the class and ID attributes
- Add styles to specific elements using the correct selectors
- Grow and shrink elements dynamically using Flexbox
